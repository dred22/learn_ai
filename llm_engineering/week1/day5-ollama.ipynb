      "A man walked into a library and asked the librarian, \"Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Schrödinger's cat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The librarian replied, \"It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if it's here or not.\"\n",

      "But just as he was about to leave, the librarian's manager came over and whispered something in her ear. The manager then looked at the man and said, \"I'm afraid we've been cat-ched off guard by your joke, but I think we can take it one step further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The librarian smiled mischievously and said, \"Why don't you paws for a moment while we check if the book is indeed here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the man waited patiently while the librarian checked the shelves. After what felt like an eternity, she finally came back with a book on Pavlov's dogs and Schrödinger's cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man exclaimed, \"Wow, I guess my joke really did ring true!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he was about to open the book, the librarian's manager appeared once again and whispered something in her ear. This time, the manager looked at the man and said, \"I think we've been purr-fecting our puns for too long. Let's try to take it up a notch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The librarian smiled slyly and said, \"Why don't you just cat-alogue your way through that book, and I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the man sat down with the book and began to read. But as he delved deeper into the pages, he realized that the joke was never really about Pavlov's dogs and Schrödinger's cat at all...\n",
      "\n",
      "...it was actually a long story about how his aunt Mildred had been searching for a new pet, but kept getting distracted by her obsession with cats. Meanwhile, her neighbor, Mr. Jenkins, had been trying to train his dog, Max, to sit on command, but kept getting interrupted by the sound of Schrödinger's cat meowing outside...\n",
      "\n",
      "...and that's when it hit him – the real punchline was a joke about how Pavlov's dogs and Schrödinger's cat were actually related to each other in a way that was both purr-fectly obvious and fur-bulous!\n",
